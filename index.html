                            <p class="story_one">I like making – magic or otherwise ordinary things. Although there are no ordinary things in my view. For instance, my painting One step from... is a view on a rubbish dump somewhere in between the meandering Thames. I like contrasts, knowledge and those moments just before the storm.  Storms I like too. I am also a very good friend with a blue tit named Kyria and I have a sailing boat.<br><br>
                            I can be serious – my works have been exhibited in Germany, England and Macedonia. I have been commissioned by private persons as well as institutions in England, Poland and Germany.Also should you be interested in my work as a translator please go to contact section.<br><br> 
                            I paint, draw, photograph or describe what I consider beautiful. What I consider beautiful is pretty much a synthesis of Pythagorean views plus a pinch of Pseudo-Dionysius. To me beauty is the proportion pleasing to the eye and the light shining through it. A marriage of psyche and soma. You should also read my poem about a dong - I even made an effort to translate it for You.
                            <br><br> 
                            My inspirations I take from nature, daughter of God par excellence. As languages are my passion, parallel with painting I am immensely interested in European prehistoric past, starting from, lets say Neolithic Revolution. You will find themes in my paintings that reflect both of my Muses. Through my years of working in a pub, I started taking interest in portraying people, especially drunk ones. What I would give to live for a week with Monsieur Lautrec…?
                            <br><br> 
                            I hope you will find in my art something pleasing to Your eye. Or maybe something I said or created will become an inspiration for You, to make your own work. Either way, enjoy!</p>
